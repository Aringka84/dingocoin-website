            us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services or otherwise when you contact us. The
            personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make
            and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect may include the following: passwords; usernames; and

            <p><b style="color:black">Information Automatically Collected</b></p>
            <p>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal
            your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP
            address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country,
            location, information about how and when you use our Services and other technical information. This information is primarily
            needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes. The

                location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access
                to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. Note however, if you choose to opt out, you may
                not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.</li>

                unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). When we
                have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
                information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives),

            collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As
            such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not
            to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about
            that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
